This is a tutoring website that I developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It runs on a webserver and includes user login and authentication. Please check out the project report for more details on the implementation process, and additional functionality!

How to deploy my webpage on a local machine

1.	Install node.js
2.	Copy the "tutoringwebsite” directory to your local machine (Windows 10)
3.	In the “tutoringwebsite” directory, type the following to install the required packages and start the web server (port 8081).
    –	npm init -y
    –	npm install express --save
    –	npm install body-parser --save
    –	npm install cors –-save
    –	node server.js

After that, you can use a browser to open index.html in the public directory.
